# 4InARow
The project is the 4-in-a-row game, played between 2 phones. 
In order for 2 different phones to join a shared game both phones will see all the ongoing changes in the game.
I used the Firestore Database,an external cloud-based database, to implement the game. 
I stored the games and the users of the game in the database. 
I saved all the data using collections, where each collection contains documents, and each document has properties representing the game document and user details.
