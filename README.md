# 4InARow
The project is the 4-in-a-row game, played between 2 users on 2 phones.
In order to enable two phones to join a shared and notify all the  ongoing changes in the game, I used the Firestore Database, an external cloud-based database.
I stored the games and the users of the game in the database.
I saved all the data using collections, where each collection contains documents, and each document has properties representing the game document and user details.
